# Discogs-to-Notion

With this project, I wanted to practice accessing and transforming data through API’s. I’ll use both the API’s of tools called Notion and Discogs. I use Notion on a daily basis for various note-taking purposes. Also, I find Notion a sleek and intuitive tool to use. However, when it comes to digitally documenting my vinyl collection, Discogs is the better tool. It has a large music database with lots of metadata, which makes it the more useful platform for looking up albums and adding them to my digital vinyl collection. However, I don’t like it’s aesthetic and I don’t use it on a daily basis like Notion. Therefore, I decided to build this tool with the goal that I only have to add records in Discogs every now and then, but can access an overview of my full vinyl collection in Notion.
